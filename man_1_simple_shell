.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[
.I command_string
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that reads commands from either
the standard input or from a file and executes them.

.B hsh
conforms to the POSIX specification for shells, with some limitations.

.SH INVOCATION
.B hsh
can be invoked both interactively and non-interactively. If
.B hsh
is invoked with standard input not connected to a terminal, it reads and
executes received commands in order.

If
.B hsh
is invoked with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by
.BR isatty (3)),
an interactive shell is opened. When executing interactively,
.B hsh
displays the prompt
.B $
when it is ready to read a command.

.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After receiving a command,
.B hsh
tokenizes it into words using
.B " "
(space) as a delimiter. The first word is treated as the command and the
remaining words are treated as arguments to that command.
.B hsh
then proceeds with the following actions:

1. If the command is a shell builtin, the builtin is executed.

2. If the command contains a slash
.BR / ,
.B hsh
assumes it is the pathname of the command and attempts to execute it.

3. If the command does not contain a slash,
.B hsh
searches for it in the directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable. If found, the command is executed.

4. If the command is not found,
.B hsh
prints an error message and returns to the prompt.

.SH BUILTIN COMMANDS
The following builtin commands are supported:

.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.

.TP
.B exit
Cause
.B hsh
to exit. No status argument is supported.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B hsh
inherits the environment from its parent process and makes it available
to child processes.

.TP
.B PATH
A colon-separated list of directories in which the shell looks for commands.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
returns the exit status of the last command executed, unless a syntax
error occurs, in which case it exits with a non-zero status.

.SH EXAMPLES
Run
.B hsh
in interactive mode:
.PP
.RS
$ ./hsh
.br
$ ls
.br
file1 file2 directory1
.br
$ exit
.br
$
.RE

Run
.B hsh
in non-interactive mode:
.PP

$ echo "ls" | ./hsh
